Assignment summary:
1. Analyse the time evolution of the droplet radius R(t) and plot it with error bar
2. Relate the droplet’s radius R to the contact angle θ using the spherical cap approximation and solve for droplet height H
3. Calculate the contact line speed U using the radius data
4. Plot U as a function of time and compute the mean speed with error estimates
5. Fit the experimental data for speed U as a function of the contact angle θ
6. Determine the most appropriate spreading law based on residuals and chi-squared values
